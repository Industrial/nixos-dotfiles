# Overview  
Volund is a modern, Rust-based tiling window manager named after the legendary smith VÃ¶lund from Norse mythology. It provides a fast, safe, and efficient way to manage windows on Linux systems using the Wayland protocol. Volund is designed for developers and power users who want a window manager that combines the efficiency of tiling layouts with the safety guarantees of Rust and the modern architecture of Wayland.

The core problem Volund solves is the need for a window manager that is both performant and safe, while providing the flexibility and customization that developers require. Traditional window managers like DWM are powerful but written in C, which can lead to memory safety issues. Volund addresses this by leveraging Rust's ownership system while maintaining the efficiency and functionality that users expect from a tiling window manager.

# Core Features  
## Native Wayland Compositor
- **What it does**: Implements a full Wayland compositor using the Smithay library, providing native Wayland protocol support
- **Why it's important**: Wayland is the future of Linux graphics, offering better security, performance, and modern features compared to X11
- **How it works**: Uses Smithay's compositor framework to handle Wayland clients, manage surfaces, and coordinate with the display server

## Tiling Layout Engine
- **What it does**: Provides multiple tiling algorithms including master-stack, monocle, and floating layouts with dynamic switching
- **Why it's important**: Efficient use of screen real estate and predictable window placement for productivity
- **How it works**: Layout algorithms calculate window positions and sizes based on available space and user preferences

## Workspace Management System
- **What it does**: Manages 9 workspaces with tag-based organization and seamless switching
- **Why it's important**: Allows users to organize applications by task or project, improving workflow efficiency
- **How it works**: Each workspace maintains its own window stack and layout state, with hotkey-based navigation

## Key Binding System
- **What it does**: Provides configurable keyboard shortcuts for all window management operations
- **Why it's important**: Enables efficient, keyboard-driven workflow without requiring mouse interaction
- **How it works**: Uses Wayland's input handling to capture key events and map them to window manager actions

## XWayland Compatibility Layer
- **What it does**: Provides seamless support for X11 applications through XWayland integration
- **Why it's important**: Ensures compatibility with legacy applications while maintaining Wayland's benefits
- **How it works**: Integrates XWayland server to handle X11 clients within the Wayland environment

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **Developer**: Uses multiple terminals, IDEs, and development tools; needs efficient workspace organization
- **Power User**: Demands keyboard-driven workflow and extensive customization options
- **System Administrator**: Requires reliable, stable window management for server administration tasks

## Key User Flows
1. **Application Launch**: User presses Super+Return to spawn terminal, Super+p for application launcher
2. **Window Navigation**: User uses Super+j/k to cycle through windows, Super+h/l for monitor switching
3. **Workspace Management**: User presses Super+1-9 to switch workspaces, Super+Shift+1-9 to move windows
4. **Layout Switching**: User presses Super+Space to cycle through available layouts
5. **Window Manipulation**: User uses Super+Tab to toggle floating, mouse drag for window movement

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Minimal Visual Overhead**: Clean borders and status bar with configurable themes
- **Immediate Feedback**: Instant response to key presses and window operations
- **Consistent Behavior**: Predictable window placement and focus management
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
