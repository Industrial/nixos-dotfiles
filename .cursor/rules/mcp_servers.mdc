Always use the following MCP servers for all operations:

### Context7
- Use for fetching up-to-date documentation for libraries and packages
- Essential for Nix package documentation and API references
- Helps with understanding package configurations and options

### Serena
- Use for code analysis, symbol finding, and refactoring operations
- Essential for navigating complex Nix expressions and modules
- Helps with understanding code structure and dependencies

### Git
- Use for all version control operations
- Essential for tracking configuration changes
- Helps with managing dotfiles history and rollbacks

## Usage Patterns
- Always check for available MCP servers before starting operations
- Use Context7 for documentation lookups
- Use Serena for code analysis and navigation
- Use Git for version control operations
- Combine MCP servers for comprehensive analysis
